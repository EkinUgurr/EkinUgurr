# Hi there, I'm Ekin 👋  
**Embedded Systems & Power Electronics Engineer and Enthusiast**  
Izmir → Open to the world 🌍

I like circuits, embedded programming, and turning signals into meaning.  
I enjoy building things that *sense*, *decide*, and *do*.

---

### 🧠 What I Do
- Write **firmware** for microcontrollers (STM32, ESP32, MSP430, PIC)
- Design and simulate **power converters & inverters** (MATLAB/Simulink)
- Create **IoT-enabled embedded systems** that connect with the real world and learning RTOS.

---

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools I Use
**Languages:** C, Embedded C  
**Microcontrollers:** STM32, ESP32, MSP430, PIC  
**Power Electronics:** Buck/Boost Converters, PWM Motor Control, 3-Phase Inverters  
**Tools:** KiCad, Code Composer Studio, Proteus, MATLAB/Simulink  
**Other:** FFT, GCC-PHAT, I²S audio interfaces

### 🛠 Projects (coming here soon)
| Project | What it Does | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Sound Localization with ESP32 + I²S** | Determines angle of sound in real-time using GCC-PHAT | Uploading soon 🎧 |
| **3-Phase Inverter Simulation** | SPWM control + harmonic analysis + load response modeling | Preparing repo ⚡ |
| **Buck/Boost Converter Notes** | Control strategy comparison + efficiency analysis | Organizing docs 🔄 |

---

### 🎯 What I'm Learning Next
- Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for BLDC/PMSM motors  
- ESP32 communication + lightweight IoT protocols (MQTT)  
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing methods

---

### 🌱 Philosophy
Keep learning. Keep improving.
